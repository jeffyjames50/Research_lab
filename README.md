In this branch the performance of the seperately trained recommendation models for each age group is evaluated using. Prediction error is computed using MAE.

The dataset is splitted into 7 groups according to the agegroup of the user which stored in Sperately_trained_age_data.zip. Models are separately trained on each of these datasets.
abc-test.csv in Sperately_trained_age_data.zip is the test file.

The code uses java version 21

Inorder to run the code, clone the branch, upload the folder and run the program in any IDE that supports java. Use the users.csv file in the Sperately_trained_age_data.zip and 
update the path to the file in line 27 in Main.java as per the location of file in your local. 
Give the path to each dataset based on age in increasing order in lines 50-56 in Main.java as per the location of file in your local.
